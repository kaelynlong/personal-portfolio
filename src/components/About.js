      <h1>ABOUT</h1>
      <p className="about-description">
        I’m a third-year computer science student at the University of Michigan’s College of Engineering, with a minor in UX Design and Statistics. I’m passionate about creating accessible, polished user interfaces that seamlessly combine design creativity with the precision of engineering. My work often focuses on the intersection of design and development, where I enjoy building experiences that are not only visually engaging but also crafted with an eye for usability and inclusivity.
      </p>
      <p className="about-description">
        Beyond UI and accessibility, I’m also deeply interested in statistics and quantitative algorithms, which fuel my approach to problem-solving and drive my fascination with the data-driven aspects of software design. I’m motivated by a commitment to innovative thinking and aspire to build solutions that don’t just meet user needs but push the boundaries of what’s possible in technology.
      </p>
      <p className="about-description">
        In the past, I’ve had the opportunity to apply these skills in various contexts — from internships and research to student organizations — where I’ve been able to develop a strong foundation in both creative and analytical approaches to technology. These experiences have solidified my dedication to making a positive impact through tech, through both user-centered design and data-driven innovation.
      </p>
      <p className="about-description">
        In my free time, I enjoy exploring fashion, painting, and reading. I’m always excited to bring together these interests to shape projects that bridge creativity with practical solutions that drive lasting change.
